## Why My UI and UX and code implementation is the best?

UI and UX
 I think I've designed it as simple as possible, make it user friendly and included some very useful informations that would really helps the travellers, I've also added some animations to change its background that based on the current weather of the selected place to make it more attractive

Codes
 On my codes, I've write it as a few lines as possible, added comment on every methods and use appropriate naming conventions. I've also write reausable codes and avoid long lines to make it easier to read,
